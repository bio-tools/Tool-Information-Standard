This site was originally set up to describe a specific **information standard** used by  **bio.tools** [^1] - the Tools and Data Services Registry of the ELIXIR [^4] research infrastructure.  A great deal has changed since then, and this site is being repurposed to cover a whole stack of information standards for the desription of bioinformatics software tools.  Of particular interest is new development called **Tool information profiles**.  These define lists of software attributes (from biotoolsCore) that can, should or must be specified for different types of tools within a set of tool descriptions. An individual profile - a JSON file conforming to toolInfoProfileSchema (JSON schema) - defines an **information requirements** that is tailored to an individual communities (national, scientific or technical).  Tool information profiles provide a practical **curation framework** and **metrics** for any corpus of tools. {[repo](http://github.com/bio-tools/tool-information-profile)}
