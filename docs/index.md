introduction: |
  A stack of community-defined, open and integrated technologies, technical standards and guidelines:

  <p align="center"> <img src="docs/assets/images/technology_stack.png" /></p>

  - Comprehensive list of scientific, technical and administrative **software attributes** to support cataloguing, discovery, use and interoperability of software
  - Precise tool descriptions in terms of their operations, types of input and output data, data formats and common topics, using the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology)
  - A practical description model for bioinformatics software - biotoolsSchema - which reduces the complexity of bioinformatics software into collections of readily understandable functional units.
  - Controlled vocabularies for consistent descriptions of technical software aspects such as programming language and license.
  - Define which software attributes that can, should or must be specified for different types of tools within a set of tool descriptions, using tool information profiles. 
  - [Broadly applicable to diverse types of tool](#tooltypes) including application software, workflows and APIs. 
  - User-friendly guidelines on how attribute should be specified when describing software.
  - Built by an [open community](#community).
