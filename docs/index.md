introduction: |
  An **information standard** for software description that defines attributes that must be defined within a 5-tier scale of description completeness and quality.  It is based on [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema) and the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology). The standard is used by [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) - the ELIXIR Tools and Data Services Registry.

  - [Broadly applicable to diverse types of tool](#tooltypes) including application software, workflows and APIs. 
  - Uses software attributes defined in [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema).
  - Makes heavy use of controlled vocabularies including the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) for types of data, data formats, operations and common topics.
  - It is an [open community-driven project](#community).
